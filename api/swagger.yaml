      summary: '# Token Handling using OAuth2'
      description: "This page lists OAuth 2 utility endpoints used for authorization,\
        \ token refresh and revoke.\nNote endpoints other than `/api/o/authorize/`\
        \ are not meant to be used in browsers and do not\nsupport HTTP GET. The endpoints\
        \ here strictly follow\n[RFC specs for OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749),\
        \ so please use that for detailed\nreference. Note AWX net location default\
        \ to `http://localhost:8013` in examples:\n\n\n## Create Token for an Application\
        \ using Authorization code grant type\nGiven an application \"AuthCodeApp\"\
        \ of grant type `authorization-code`, \nfrom the client app, the user makes\
        \ a GET to the Authorize endpoint with \n\n* `response_type`\n* `client_id`\n\
        * `redirect_uris`\n* `scope`  \n\nAWX will respond with the authorization\
        \ `code` and `state`\nto the redirect_uri specified in the application. The\
        \ client application will then make a POST to the\n`api/o/token/` endpoint\
        \ on AWX with\n\n* `code`\n* `client_id`\n* `client_secret`\n* `grant_type`\n\
        * `redirect_uri`\n\nAWX will respond with the `access_token`, `token_type`,\
        \ `refresh_token`, and `expires_in`. For more\ninformation on testing this\
        \ flow, refer to [django-oauth-toolkit](http://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial_01.html#test-your-authorization-server).\n\
        \n\n## Create Token for an Application using Password grant type\n\nLog in\
        \ is not required for `password` grant type, so a simple `curl` can be used\
        \ to acquire a personal access token\nvia `/api/o/token/` with \n\n* `grant_type`:\
        \ Required to be \"password\"\n* `username`\n* `password`\n* `client_id`:\
        \ Associated application must have grant_type \"password\"\n* `client_secret`\n\
        \nFor example:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\
        \ \\\n  -d \"grant_type=password&username=<username>&password=<password>&scope=read\"\
        \ \\\n  -u \"gwSPoasWSdNkMDtBN3Hu2WYQpPWCO9SwUEsKK22l:fI6ZpfocHYBGfm1tP92r0yIgCyfRdDQt0Tos9L8a4fNsJjQQMwp9569e\n\

        \ \\\n  http://localhost:8013/api/o/token/ -i\n```\nIn the above post request,\
        \ parameters `username` and `password` are username and password of the related\n\
        AWX user of the underlying application, and the authentication information\
        \ is of format\n`<client_id>:<client_secret>`, where `client_id` and `client_secret`\
        \ are the corresponding fields of\nunderlying application.\n\nUpon success,\

        ## Format

        Use the `format` query string parameter to specify the output format.

        * Browsable API: `?format=api`
        * HTML: `?format=html`
        * Plain Text: `?format=txt`
        * Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi`
        * JSON structure: `?format=json`
        * Downloaded Plain Text: `?format=txt_download`
        * Downloaded Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi_download`

        (_New in Ansible Tower 2.0.0_) When using the Browsable API, HTML and JSON
        formats, the `start_line` and `end_line` query string parameters can be used
        to specify a range of line numbers to retrieve.

        Use `dark=1` or `dark=0` as a query string parameter to force or disable a
        dark background.

        Files over 1.0 MB (configurable)
        will not display in the browser. Use the `txt_download` or `ansi_download`
        formats to download the file directly to view it.

         - For instances with `node_type` of "control" or "hybrid", health checks are
        performed as part of a periodic task that runs in the background.
         - For instances with `node_type` of "execution", health checks are done by submitting
        a work unit through the receptor mesh.

        If ran through the receptor mesh, the invoked command is:

        ```
        ansible-runner worker --worker-info
        ```

        For execution nodes, these checks are _not_ performed on a regular basis.
        Health checks against functional nodes will be ran when the node is first discovered.
        Health checks against nodes with errors will be repeated at a reduced frequency.




        # Manually Initiate a Health Check
        For purposes of error remediation or debugging, a health check can be
        manually initiated by making a POST request to this endpoint.

        This will submit the work unit to the target node through the receptor mesh and wait for it to finish.
        The model will be updated with the result.
        Up-to-date values of the fields will be returned in the response data.

        Refer to [Dynamic Inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html)
        for more information on inventory scripts.

        ## List Response

        Make a GET request to this resource without query parameters to retrieve a JSON
        object containing groups, including the hosts, children and variables for each
        group.  The response data is equivalent to that returned by passing the
        `--list` argument to an inventory script.

        Specify a query string of `?hostvars=1` to retrieve the JSON
        object above including all host variables.  The `['_meta']['hostvars']` object
        in the response contains an entry for each host with its variables.  This
        response format can be used with Ansible 1.3 and later to avoid making a
        separate API request for each host.  Refer to
        [Tuning the External Inventory Script](http://docs.ansible.com/developing_inventory.html#tuning-the-external-inventory-script)
        for more information on this feature.

        By default, the inventory script will only return hosts that
        are enabled in the inventory.  This feature allows disabled hosts to be skipped
        when running jobs without removing them from the inventory.  Specify a query
        string of `?all=1` to return all hosts, including disabled ones.

        Specify a query string of `?towervars=1` to add variables
        to the hostvars of each host that specifies its enabled state and database ID.

        Specify a query string of `?subset=slice2of5` to produce an inventory that
        has a restricted number of hosts according to the rules of job slicing.

        To apply multiple query strings, join them with the `&` character, like `?hostvars=1&all=1`.

        ## Host Response

        Make a GET request to this resource with a query string similar to
        `?host=HOSTNAME` to retrieve a JSON object containing host variables for the
        specified host.  The response data is equivalent to that returned by passing
        the `--host HOSTNAME` argument to an inventory script.

        inventory update.

        ## Format

        Use the `format` query string parameter to specify the output format.

        * Browsable API: `?format=api`
        * HTML: `?format=html`
        * Plain Text: `?format=txt`
        * Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi`
        * JSON structure: `?format=json`
        * Downloaded Plain Text: `?format=txt_download`
        * Downloaded Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi_download`

        (_New in Ansible Tower 2.0.0_) When using the Browsable API, HTML and JSON
        formats, the `start_line` and `end_line` query string parameters can be used
        to specify a range of line numbers to retrieve.

        Use `dark=1` or `dark=0` as a query string parameter to force or disable a
        dark background.

        Files over 1.0 MB (configurable)
        will not display in the browser. Use the `txt_download` or `ansi_download`
        formats to download the file directly to view it.

      summary: The job template callback allows for ephemeral hosts to launch a new
        job.
      description: |-
        Configure a host to POST to this resource, passing the `host_config_key`
        parameter, to start a new job limited to only the requesting host.  In the
        examples below, replace the `N` parameter with the `id` of the job template
        and the `HOST_CONFIG_KEY` with the `host_config_key` associated with the
        job template.

        For example, using curl:

            curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY"}'  http://server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        Or using wget:

            wget -O /dev/null --post-data='{"host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY"}' --header=Content-Type:application/json http://server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        You may also pass `extra_vars` to the callback:

            curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY", "extra_vars": {"key": "value"}}'  http://server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        The response will return status 202 if the request is valid, 403 for an
        invalid host config key, or 400 if the host cannot be determined from the
        address making the request.

        _(New in Ansible Tower 2.0.0)_  If the associated inventory has the
        `update_on_launch` flag set and if the `update_cache_timeout` has expired, the
        callback will perform an inventory sync to find a matching host.

        A GET request may be used to verify that the correct host will be selected.
        This request must authenticate as a valid user with permission to edit the
        job template.  For example:

            curl http://user:password@server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        The response will include the host config key as well as the host name(s)

      summary: The job template callback allows for ephemeral hosts to launch a new
        job.
      description: |-
        Configure a host to POST to this resource, passing the `host_config_key`
        parameter, to start a new job limited to only the requesting host.  In the
        examples below, replace the `N` parameter with the `id` of the job template
        and the `HOST_CONFIG_KEY` with the `host_config_key` associated with the
        job template.

        For example, using curl:

            curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY"}'  http://server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        Or using wget:

            wget -O /dev/null --post-data='{"host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY"}' --header=Content-Type:application/json http://server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        You may also pass `extra_vars` to the callback:

            curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY", "extra_vars": {"key": "value"}}'  http://server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        The response will return status 202 if the request is valid, 403 for an
        invalid host config key, or 400 if the host cannot be determined from the
        address making the request.

        _(New in Ansible Tower 2.0.0)_  If the associated inventory has the
        `update_on_launch` flag set and if the `update_cache_timeout` has expired, the
        callback will perform an inventory sync to find a matching host.

        A GET request may be used to verify that the correct host will be selected.
        This request must authenticate as a valid user with permission to edit the
        job template.  For example:

            curl http://user:password@server/api/v2/job_templates/N/callback/

        The response will include the host config key as well as the host name(s)
        that would match the request:

            {
                "host_config_key": "HOST_CONFIG_KEY",
                "matching_hosts": ["hostname"]
            }

        job.

        ## Format

        Use the `format` query string parameter to specify the output format.

        * Browsable API: `?format=api`
        * HTML: `?format=html`
        * Plain Text: `?format=txt`
        * Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi`
        * JSON structure: `?format=json`
        * Downloaded Plain Text: `?format=txt_download`
        * Downloaded Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi_download`

        (_New in Ansible Tower 2.0.0_) When using the Browsable API, HTML and JSON
        formats, the `start_line` and `end_line` query string parameters can be used
        to specify a range of line numbers to retrieve.

        Use `dark=1` or `dark=0` as a query string parameter to force or disable a
        dark background.

        Files over 1.0 MB (configurable)
        will not display in the browser. Use the `txt_download` or `ansi_download`
        formats to download the file directly to view it.

        project update.

        ## Format

        Use the `format` query string parameter to specify the output format.

        * Browsable API: `?format=api`
        * HTML: `?format=html`
        * Plain Text: `?format=txt`
        * Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi`
        * JSON structure: `?format=json`
        * Downloaded Plain Text: `?format=txt_download`
        * Downloaded Plain Text with ANSI color codes: `?format=ansi_download`

        (_New in Ansible Tower 2.0.0_) When using the Browsable API, HTML and JSON
        formats, the `start_line` and `end_line` query string parameters can be used
        to specify a range of line numbers to retrieve.

        Use `dark=1` or `dark=0` as a query string parameter to force or disable a
        dark background.

        Files over 1.0 MB (configurable)
        will not display in the browser. Use the `txt_download` or `ansi_download`
        formats to download the file directly to view it.

        \ structure contains:\n\n    {\n        \"count\": 99,\n        \"next\":\
        \ null,\n        \"previous\": null,\n        \"results\": [\n           \
        \ ...\n        ]\n    }\n\nThe `count` field indicates the total number of\
        \ workflow job nodes\nfound for the given query.  The `next` and `previous`\
        \ fields provides links to\nadditional results if there are more than will\
        \ fit on a single page.  The\n`results` list contains zero or more workflow\
        \ job node records.  \n\n## Results\n\nEach workflow job node data structure\
        \ includes the following fields:\n\n* `id`: Database ID for this workflow\
        \ job node. (integer)\n* `type`: Data type for this workflow job node. (choice)\n\
        * `url`: URL for this workflow job node. (string)\n* `related`: Data structure\
        \ with URLs of related resources. (object)\n* `summary_fields`: Data structure\
        \ with name/description for related resources.  The output for some objects\
        \ may be limited for performance reasons. (object)\n* `created`: Timestamp\
        \ when this workflow job node was created. (datetime)\n* `modified`: Timestamp\
        \ when this workflow job node was last modified. (datetime)\n* `extra_data`:\
        \  (json)\n* `inventory`: Inventory applied as a prompt, assuming job template\
        \ prompts for inventory (id)\n* `scm_branch`:  (string)\n* `job_type`:  (choice)\n\
        \    - `None`: ---------\n    - `\"\"`: ---------\n    - `run`: Run\n    -\
        \ `check`: Check\n* `job_tags`:  (string)\n* `skip_tags`:  (string)\n* `limit`:\
        \  (string)\n* `diff_mode`:  (boolean)\n* `verbosity`:  (choice)\n    - `None`:\
        \ ---------\n    - `0`: 0 (Normal)\n    - `1`: 1 (Verbose)\n    - `2`: 2 (More\
        \ Verbose)\n    - `3`: 3 (Debug)\n    - `4`: 4 (Connection Debug)\n    - `5`:\
        \ 5 (WinRM Debug)\n* `job`:  (id)\n* `workflow_job`:  (id)\n* `unified_job_template`:\
        \  (id)\n* `success_nodes`:  (field)\n* `failure_nodes`:  (field)\n* `always_nodes`:\
        \  (field)\n* `all_parents_must_converge`: If enabled then the node will only\
        \ run if all of the parent nodes have met the criteria to reach this node\
        \ (boolean)\n* `do_not_run`: Indicates that a job will not be created when\
        \ True. Workflow runtime semantics will mark this True if the node is in a\
        \ path that will decidedly not be ran. A value of False means the node may\
        \ not run. (boolean)\n* `identifier`: An identifier coresponding to the workflow\
        \ job template node that this node was created from. (string)\n\n\n\n## Sorting\n\
        \nTo specify that workflow job nodes are returned in a particular\norder,\
        \ use the `order_by` query string parameter on the GET request.\n\n    ?order_by=name\n\
        \nPrefix the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:\n\n    ?order_by=-name\n\
        \nMultiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with\
        \ a\ncomma `,`:\n\n    ?order_by=name,some_other_field\n\n## Pagination\n\n\
        Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results\n\
        returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve\n\
        a particular page of results.\n\n    ?page_size=100&page=2\n\nThe `previous`\
        \ and `next` links returned with the results will set these query\nstring\
        \ parameters automatically.\n\n## Searching\n\nUse the `search` query string\
        \ parameter to perform a case-insensitive search\nwithin all designated text\
        \ fields of a model.\n\n    ?search=findme\n\n(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_)\
        \ Search across related fields:\n\n    ?related__search=findme"
